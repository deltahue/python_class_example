# A sample class with a `from_file()` method

This repository contains a short demo, how to implement a `.from_file()` method in a python class to initialize it.

It contains a sample class and a sample config yaml file which show the behaviour. I think this can be really useful in larger projects to keep the initialization of classes flexible.

Credit goes to Lukas Fr√∂hlich's [bayesopt4ros](https://github.com/lukasfro/bayesopt4ros/) repo, where I have seen this the first time.

Any feedback is always welcome! :)
